# Our E School

## I open sourced this project because I wasn't got paid

### An open source project for school management

## I've used Provider + Get_it for State Management

## MVVM(Model-View-(View)Model) Architecture

Our E School is the app build for iOS and Android using Flutter.

It uses Firebase FireStore as Database and Firebase Storage.

### Note: This app is not fully developed, it still has a lot of bugs and I'm still working on it

#### There are backend firebase functions too written in Typescript for some automation and some functions to make them work with web based project(future proof)
